# mac-keymap-gui

A visual key remapping tool for macOS supporting layers and tap-hold functionality.

## Development

Install dependencies and start the app:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

Key presses are detected in `preload.js` and printed to the developer console.
On macOS, common modifier keys are displayed with their Mac-specific names, such
as Command (⌘) and Option (⌥).

To run the placeholder test script:

```bash
npm test
```
